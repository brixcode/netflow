Netflow
=======

This project is a set of python scripts and queries to support the deployment
of netflow data collection and analysis.  Netflow collection is handled by
nfcapd from the nfdump tools [http://nfdump.sourceforge.net/].  The scripts
handle the management of the listener, the data export from binary netflow
to ascii, and the cleanup of binary and ascii log files.

The ascii output is intended for consumption by Splunk.  The required stanzas
for Splunk are created in the conf directory in the inputs.conf file.  This
script will NOT automatically update an existing Splunk confiuration, so
the input stanzas will need to be transcribed to the appropriate Splunk
config file.

The Python scripts were developed using Python 2.7 and have not been tested
against Python 3.x

Prequisites
nfdump tools, notably nfcapd and nfdump, compiled locally and installed in
/usr/local/bin - this is the default location for installation

Splunk forwarder or Splunk Enterprise installation on the local system

The configure.py script needs to run as root or with sudo since it needs to
write to /opt
